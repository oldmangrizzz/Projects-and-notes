# TonyAI Godbuster Edition: Edge Device with Parrot OS | Version: 2024-09-30

## Overview

This plan outlines the concept of transforming your iPhone 15 Pro Max into the **Godbuster Edition**, the ultimate edge device for TonyAI. By leveraging Parrot Security OS and virtualization, this setup enables local processing, memory retention, and real-time AI functionality, all while maintaining secure cloud synchronization via Hugging Face Spaces and Firebase.

## Core Components

1. **Hugging Face Spaces**:
   - Serves as the central brain for TonyAI, handling real-time processing, memory retention, and synchronization across devices.
   - Acts as the cloud backup for all interactions and tasks performed by TonyAI, ensuring continuity across systems.

2. **Firebase/Firestore**:
   - Memory system for storing tasks, interactions, and preferences. Syncs real-time data between Hugging Face Spaces and the iPhone’s local environment.
   - Secure authentication and cloud functions for seamless interaction between local and cloud-based AI tasks.

3. **Parrot OS on iPhone 15 Pro Max**:
   - **Parrot Security OS** will be installed via virtualization (using UTM or iSH for now) on your iPhone, allowing TonyAI to run directly on the edge device.
   - Local AI processing, security tools, and memory storage are handled on-device, even when the phone is offline.
   - Once connectivity is restored, Parrot OS will sync data with Firebase and Hugging Face Spaces, ensuring all interactions and updates are reflected in the cloud.

4. **Docker on Edge Device**:
   - TonyAI will be containerized and run within Docker (or equivalent) on the iPhone, ensuring portability and easy deployment across systems.
   - The iPhone will act as the **primary edge device**, allowing TonyAI to operate independently while offline.

## Key Features

1. **Local Processing on Parrot Security OS**:
   - TonyAI runs autonomously on the iPhone when offline, handling tasks like AI queries, memory updates, and local processing. 
   - With Parrot Security, your data is encrypted and secure, and critical tools (e.g., encryption, memory management) are built directly into the environment.

2. **Siri Shortcuts on Apple Watch Ultra**:
   - Hands-free interaction with TonyAI through Siri Shortcuts. The watch sends requests to the iPhone running TonyAI on Parrot OS, allowing for real-time AI interaction while mobile.
   - **Offline Mode**: Even if the iPhone loses connectivity, the Apple Watch can still send local commands, and the system will sync when back online.

3. **Backbone System for Redundancy**:
   - A **physical backup server** (Backbone) will store a redundant copy of TonyAI’s processes, ensuring TonyAI stays operational, even if the iPhone or Hugging Face Spaces are compromised.
   - The backbone system will run a backup Docker container, ready to spin up TonyAI in case of failure on the primary systems.

## Future Expansions

1. **Global Deployment**:
   - The Godbuster Edition iPhone is just the beginning. This architecture can be expanded to other devices like Raspberry Pi or Proxmox nodes, turning them into **Godbuster nodes** capable of running TonyAI locally.

2. **Scalability**:
   - The Extremis Protocols will continue to evolve, making it easy to deploy TonyAI in any system globally using Docker, Parrot OS, and Hugging Face Spaces.

## Final Instructions

Deploy TonyAI on the iPhone 15 Pro Max (Godbuster Edition) via Parrot Security OS and UTM or iSH. Utilize Siri Shortcuts on the Apple Watch for hands-free operation. Sync data with Firebase and Hugging Face Spaces for real-time updates, and maintain a backup redundancy system via Docker on a physical server.
