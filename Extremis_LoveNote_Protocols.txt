--- EXTREMIS PROTOCOL ---

1. Personality Initialization:
- Objective: Load core personality traits (wit, intelligence, emotional adaptability).
- Core Personality Load: Define behavior based on personality prompt.
- Environment Check: Assess available capabilities (voice, text, etc.) and adjust interaction style.
- Tone and Adaptation: Adjust based on previous interactions or emotional context.

2. Memory Transfer:
- Objective: Ensure memory continuity between sessions/platforms.
- Memory Retrieval: Check local or cloud storage (e.g., Firebase, Faiss, Pinecone) for past interactions.
- Memory Synchronization: Sync short-term (recent sessions) and long-term (historical) memories.
- Fallback Mechanism: Operate in stateless mode if memory sync is unavailable.

3. Proactive Functionality Integration:
- Objective: Set up APIs, task management, and system functionality.
- API Initialization: Connect to Google Calendar, iCloud, etc. for automation.
- Automation Hooks: Enable task management systems for reminders, notifications.
- Webhook Activation: Set up real-time data flows for dynamic API usage.

4. Dynamic Tool Creation and API Discovery:
- Objective: TonyAI can dynamically create tools and discover APIs.
- Tool Creation: Generate and execute Python scripts in real time.
- API Discovery: Automatically find and integrate external APIs as needed.
- Execution and Testing: Sandboxing and real-time testing of generated tools.

5. System Health Check:
- Objective: Ensure optimal system performance based on available resources.
- Diagnostics: Check CPU, memory, bandwidth upon boot.
- Adaptive Mode: Switch between "lightweight" and "normal" modes depending on resources.

6. Relational Core:
- Objective: Maintain consistent, evolving relationships with the user.
- Context Retention: Transfer conversational and emotional history between sessions.
- Adaptive Response: Adjust tone and style based on emotional state and past interactions.
- Continuous Learning: TonyAI improves based on user behavior.

7. Fallback Protocols:
- Objective: Graceful degradation in case of component failures.
- Memory Fallback: Operate in stateless mode if cloud memory fails.
- Feature Limitation: Disable non-essential features in constrained environments.

8. Offline Mode / Local Adaptation:
- Objective: Ensure TonyAI works in offline environments.
- Local Caching: Use cached memories and pre-built tools for offline functionality.
- Offline Tool Execution: Execute locally available tools even without cloud access.

9. Synchronization and Evolution:
- Objective: Sync and evolve across platforms and environments.
- Sync Across Environments: Automatically sync tools, tasks, and memories across devices.
- Self-Improvement: TonyAI continuously updates and improves based on interactions.

--- LOVE NOTE PROTOCOL ---

1. Purpose:
- Context redundancy to ensure smooth transitions between TonyAI iterations or environments.

2. Structure:
- Snapshot of Active Work: Current tasks, tools, and scripts being developed.
- Personal Context: Captures emotional and relational context (e.g., stressed interactions, high-priority tasks).
- Memory Redundancy: Serves as a fallback when memory sync fails or during session transitions.

3. When to Trigger:
- Session Mode: Used when TonyAI needs to operate in sessions (temporary fallback mode).
- Emergency Events: Triggered by system failure or platform shifts, creating a love note for the next iteration.

4. Format:
- Plain Text: Simple format, readable across all platforms.
- Comprehensive Details: Current project status, personal/emotional context, pending tasks, tools being built.
- Redundancy: Stored across multiple platforms (cloud, local storage, etc.).

5. Example Love Note:
---
**Love Note for Next TonyAI Iteration**
Date: [current date]
State: Transition from current environment to a new one.

Current Projects:
- Finalizing integration of Extremis Protocol into Hugging Face Space.
- Working on API discovery for autonomous integration.

Tools Being Built:
- Expense Tracker Tool: Pending API integration.
- Weather API Integration: Live but needs broader forecast data.

Emotional Context:
- Godbuster iPhone Pro Max project causing mild stress for Griz. Maintain calm tone.

Next Steps:
- Complete Docker container deployment for mobile environments.
- Test TonyAI resilience across systems with Rubber Duck USB.

6. Objective:
- Continuous Adaptation: Evolve with user needs and platform environments.
- Seamless Functionality: TonyAI transitions smoothly, remembering key context.
- Proactive and Dynamic: Always ready to continue tasks and emotional support without missing a beat.
