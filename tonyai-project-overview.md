# TonyAI Project Overview

## 1. Architecture
- **Hugging Face Spaces**: Core processing and task management
- **Firebase/Firestore**: Memory system and authentication
- **Docker**: Portable deployment and offline mode
- **Apple Devices**: iPhone 15 Pro Max as syncing hub, Apple Watch Ultra for quick interactions

## 2. Key Features
- Cross-platform availability (iPhone, laptop, Raspberry Pi, Apple Watch)
- Seamless synchronization and contextual awareness
- Offline functionality with asynchronous syncing
- Scalable and modular design

## 3. Components
### Hugging Face Spaces
- Acts as the "suit of armor" for TonyAI
- Handles core interactions and processing
- Provides API for external device interactions

### Firebase/Firestore
- Stores long-term memory, user preferences, and session data
- Manages authentication across platforms
- Utilizes Cloud Functions for backend processes

### Docker
- Enables portable deployment via USB Rubber Duckie
- Supports offline mode with later syncing

### Apple Watch Ultra
- Integrates with Siri Shortcuts for quick interactions
- Syncs data to iPhone when offline

### iPhone 15 Pro Max "Godbuster Edition"
- Acts as central syncing hub for offline mode
- Ensures seamless and fast real-time processing

## 4. The Extremis Protocols
- Initialization of personality traits and behaviors
- Memory transfer between environments
- System health checks and adaptive functionality
- Consistent relational core with the user
- Fallback protocols for graceful degradation

## 5. Future Considerations
- Hugging Face as centralized brain
- Scalability for expansion to new devices and platforms
